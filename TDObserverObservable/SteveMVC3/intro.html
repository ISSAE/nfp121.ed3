<dt><b>I. Relationships between objects in an application</b>
  <ol><li>Is-A (inheritance)
      <li>Has-A (composition)
      <li>Depends-on (dependency)
      <li>Instance-of (instantiation) 
      </ol>

<p>
<dt><b>II. Defininitions</b>
  <ul><li>Model: 
     <ul type=disc><li>Contains data and core application functionality.
	<li>Independent of the user interface (<b>UI</b>).
	<li>Keywords: data, storage, processing.
     </ul>
  <li>View: 
     <ul type=disc><li>Displays a model's data to the user.
	<li>Does not understand or act on the data except as necessary to display it.
	<li>Provides the "look" of an application.
	<li>Keywords: output
     </ul>
  <li>Controller: 
     <ul type=disc><li>Handles UI events and communicates them to the model.
	<li>Usually is specialized to work with a particular view.
	<li>Provides the "feel" of an application.
	<li>Keywords: input
     </ul>
  <li>Observable:
     <ul type=disc><li>A java.util class for a <b>model</b>.
	<li>Contains a mechanism for notifying all observers upon changes in a model's data.
	<li>An observable object knows which objects depend on it and notifys them
	    upon changes to the model's data.
	<li>Key methods: setChanged(), notifyObservers()
     </ul>
  <li>Observer:
     <ul type=disc><li>A java.util interface for a <b>view</b>.
	<li>Specifies a mechanism for reacting to changes in an observed model.
	<li>An observer does not (necessarily) know on which objects it depends.
	<li>An observer does have to display anything (ie. provide a view to a model).
	<li>Key methods: update(Observable, Object)
     </ul>
  <li>EventListener:
     <ul type=disc><li>A java.util interface for a <b>controller</b>.
	<li>Specifies a mechanism for responding to UI events.
	<li>Available only in JDK 1.1 (see docs about the <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/jdk/1.1/docs/guide/awt/designspec/events.html">delegation-based event model</a>).
	<li>Key subclasses: MouseListener, ActionListener, FocusListener et al.
     </ul>
  </ul>

<p>
<dt><b>IV. A Generic Scenario</b>
  <ol><li>User generates an event by clicking a button or moving a scroll bar.
      <li>Controller determines what happened and sends a setData(value) message to a model
	  passing it a value computed based on what happened in the UI.
      <li>Model sets/ alters its data accordingly.
      <li>Model broadcasts to its dependents (views) that it has changed (calls
 	  setChanged() and notifyObservers()).
      <li>Observer (view) receives an update message from the changed model and reacts
	  appropriately (e.g, redraws its display to reflect the change in the model).
  </ol>


<p>
<dt><b>V. Advantages and Disadvantages</b>
	<p>
  <ul type=disc><li><b>Advantages of dependency</b>
     <ol><li>Dependents are updated transparently and automatically.
	 <li>Allows an application to build its dependency network at run-time.
	     For any given object, a programmer does not need to know which other objects or how many other
 	     objects depend on it.
     </ol>
	<p>
  <li><b>Advantages of MVC</b>
     <ol><li>Permits an orderly, methodical approach to GUI design.
	<li>Decouples an application's data processing, visual representation, and GUI which
	     promotes flexibility, modularity, encapsulation, and reuse. For example, 
  	     a model could be fitted with different views, or an application could
 	     be used without its view to interact with another application.
	<li>Permits separate, independent development of application components.
	<li>Allows the different components of an application to inherit from different classes.
	    This promotes encapsulation and compensates for Java's lack of multiple inheritance.
     </ol>
	<p>
  <li><b>Disadvantages of Dependency and MVC</b>
     <ol><li>Increased complexity requires more effort to design.
 	 <li>Creates a new potential source of bugs.
 	 <li>Messages between objects may be difficult to track.
	 <li>Increased overhead of method calls between observables and observers could
	     lead to inefficient code if not designed carefully.
     </ol>
